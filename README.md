# Python-OOP-Milestone-Project

My first OOP project attempt, took me many hours, but it was a good and fun experience.

Created a game of blackjack using OOP in Python.

I came up with the logic flow myself, didn't follow any walkthrough.

The game only involves one player playing against a computer dealer.

During the initial deal, both the cards for the player are faced up, while for the computer only one is faced up.

The player will first decide to hit or not, and will continue to do so until he/she stays.

The same is then followed by the computer.

Whoever wins will win the bet amount.

There is no multi-player options, nor features such as Double-Down and card splits.
