# Python-OOP-Milestone-Project

My first OOP project attempt, took me many hours, but it was a good and fun experience.

Created a game of blackjack using OOP in Python.

The game only involves one player playing against a computer dealer.
/nDuring the initial deal, both the cards for the player are faced up, while for the computer only one is faced up.
/nThe player will first decide to hit or not, and will continue to do so until he/she stays.
/nThe same is then followed by the computer.
/nWhoever wins will win the bet amount.

/nThere is no multi-player options, nor features such as Double-Down and card splits.
