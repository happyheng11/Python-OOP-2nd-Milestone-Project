# Python-OOP-Milestone-Project

My first OOP project attempt, took me many hours, but it was a good and fun experience.

Created a game of blackjack using OOP in Python.

The game only involves one player playing against a computer dealer.
The cards for the player are both faced up, while for the computer only one is faced up.
The player will first decide to hit/stop, followed by the computer.
Whoever wins will win the betted amount.

There is no multi-player options, nor features such as Double-Down and card splits.
